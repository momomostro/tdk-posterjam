# Poster Jam – The Design Kids Mexico City

This project is an idea generator specially designed for a creative workshop by **The Design Kids Mexico City**. Its goal is to spark imagination and graphic experimentation among participants through spontaneous and fun challenges.

## 🎯 What is it?

It's a web tool that, upon starting, presents two random concepts. With these two elements, participants must **design a poster** from scratch within a **10-minute time limit**, using either analog or digital tools. The idea is to encourage quick decision-making, unfiltered creativity, and graphic exploration.

## 🧠 How does it work?

1. On launch, an animated intro screen appears with the event branding.
2. Then, the generator interface displays two randomly selected concepts.
3. A **10-minute countdown** begins, during which attendees must create a poster based on those concepts.
4. After the time runs out, the process can be restarted to get a new combination.

## 👩‍🎨 Workshop goals

- Step outside the comfort zone
- Create under time pressure
- Translate abstract ideas into visual solutions
- Spark discussion and inspiration among peers
- Laugh out loud at the results

## 🛠️ Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS (custom animations)
- JavaScript (random logic and timer)

## 🚀 How to use it

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:yourusername/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

   No additional installation or internet connection is required (ideal for in-person workshops).
